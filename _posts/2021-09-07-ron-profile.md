Ron Bishop was my first graduate student. He came to Dalhousie from Paradise, Newfoundland to complete a research project in Rehabilitation Research. His project investigated how brain areas communicate during the performance of precision hand movements. After graduation, Ron worked at the hospital as an Imaging Technician for a number of years. Following that experience, he became a Data Analyst for the Department of Health and Wellness, and now manages a Data Analytics team.

>“Getting my masters at Dal was an incredible experience. I learned a lot about neuroimaging and gained so many skills related to research and writing from my supervisors. My time at Dal led directly to an opportunity to work in the field as a technologist, where I collaborated with scientists and met some amazing people." <cite>― Ron Bishop</cite>
