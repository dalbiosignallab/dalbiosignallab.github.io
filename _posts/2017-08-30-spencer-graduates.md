Thanks to Spencer Osbourne, who spent the summer with us at the Biosignal Lab. Spencer is beginning his last year of high school, and has volunteered with me the last two summers.

This summer Spencer developed some code to help our robot navigate around a room without bumping into things. He did a great job on this project, which will now be taken up by some interested students in the Physics department.

Great to have you on the team! Thanks, and good luck with Grade 12!!!
