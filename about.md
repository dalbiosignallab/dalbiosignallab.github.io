My name is Tim Bardouille. Iâ€™m an Associate Professor at Dalhousie University, and head of the Biosignal Lab. I've been non-invasively imaging the human brain since Y2K. I'm affiliated with the

The human brain is an amazingly complex system of roughly 100 billion neurons. This system is constantly developing new networks and remapping old ones as we grow and learn. When the brain is injured or develops improperly, these networks are disrupted. Amazingly, the human brain can adapt to this disruption, re-route communication, and find new ways to keep us thinking and moving. For example, this is how a person recovers mobility after a stroke. 

Non-invasive imaging technologies are helping us learn more about the brain. The technologies use basic and advanced physics principles to measure signals that are generated by activity in the brain. This may be the magnetic fields and electric potentials generated by neurons firing, or changes in the amount of oxygen in neurons when they are working hard.

My team at the Biosignal Lab focuses on magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencepholography (EEG). We collect data locally and work with large open-access datasets available around the world. Our research focuses on developing software and hardware solutions that increase the data yield from neurophysiological recordings. This interdisciplinary research combines physics, mathematics, computer science, psychology, and neuroscience to look at how signalling in the brain can change with learning, development, ageing, brain injury or disease.
